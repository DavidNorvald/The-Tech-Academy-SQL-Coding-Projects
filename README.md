# The Tech Academy SQL coding projects

This is a repo of the SQL projects that were completed while undertaking the SQL coursework. The main project was to make our own DB library and be able to access the information using C.R.U.D.
This course was very challenging as it was my first attempt at using a DB and how to access the information that was created for it, but I felt that I learned a lot by taking this course and was able to later use this information while completing my Live Project regarding a bug afflicting the Save button for saving new information to the DB using C#.
